# HopIn ~ Campus Carpooling Made Simple

**HopIn** is a campus-focused carpooling web application designed to help **University of Regina** students who live far from campus or outside Regina find affordable, reliable rides to and from the university.

Many U of R students face daily commuting challenges due to limited public transit, high fuel costs, and expensive ride-hailing services. At the same time, many drivers travel to campus with empty seats. HopIn bridges this gap by connecting drivers and riders within a trusted, university-based community.

---

## Problem Statement

- Public transit can be slow, unreliable, or limited especially during off-peak hours  
- Driving alone is costly and parking availability on campus is limited  
- Ride-hailing services are too expensive for daily commuting  
- Informal carpooling through social media is unreliable and unsafe  

---

## Solution

HopIn provides a **centralized, campus-specific carpooling platform** where:

- Drivers can post rides with routes, times, and available seats  
- Riders can browse available rides and request seats  
- Both parties benefit from affordability, transparency, and accountability  

---

## Core Features (MVP)

- **User Accounts**  
  Register using a University of Regina email and create a driver or rider profile  

- **Ride Posting**  
  Drivers can post ride details including departure location, time, and available seats  

- **Ride Search & Requests**  
  Riders can search available rides and submit ride requests  

- **Driver Approval Flow**  
  Drivers approve or decline ride requests and maintain full control  

- **Ratings & Feedback**  
  Mutual rating system to promote accountability and trust  

> **Note:**  
> Payments and advanced verification are intentionally excluded from the MVP and planned for future iterations.

---

## Technical Overview

- **Architecture:** Model-View-Controller (MVC)  
- **Core Entities:** User, Ride, Request, Rating  
- **Frontend:** Intuitive UI for posting and searching rides  
- **Backend:** Secure data management for users and ride information  

---

## Project Scope & Timeline

- **Development Timeline:** 2 months  
- **Focus:** MVP development with core functionality  
- **Goal:** Deliver a functional, scalable proof-of-concept  

---

## Future Expansion

While HopIn is initially built for the **University of Regina**, the platform is designed to scale to other universities and institutions.

Planned future enhancements include:
- In-app payments  
- Enhanced user and driver verification  
- Support for multiple campuses
